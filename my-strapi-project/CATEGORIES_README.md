# Categories and Subcategories Collections

This document describes the category and subcategory collections that have been created in the Strapi backend to support the Dyuta frontend filtering system.

## Overview

The backend now includes two new collections:
- **Category**: Top-level grouping of events/markets
- **Subcategory**: Sub-grouping inside categories

These collections are designed to match the filtering system used in the Dyuta frontend.

## Collections Structure

### Category Collection
- **name** (string, required): Display name of the category
- **slug** (uid, required): URL-friendly identifier
- **description** (text): Description of the category
- **image** (media): Optional image for the category
- **subcategories** (relation): One-to-many relationship with subcategories

### Subcategory Collection
- **name** (string, required): Display name of the subcategory
- **slug** (uid, required): URL-friendly identifier
- **description** (text): Description of the subcategory
- **image** (media): Optional image for the subcategory
- **category** (relation): Many-to-one relationship with category

## API Endpoints

Once the collections are created and seeded, the following API endpoints will be available:

### Categories
- `GET /api/categories` - Get all categories
- `GET /api/categories/:id` - Get a specific category
- `GET /api/categories/:id?populate=subcategories` - Get category with subcategories

### Subcategories
- `GET /api/subcategories` - Get all subcategories
- `GET /api/subcategories/:id` - Get a specific subcategory
- `GET /api/subcategories?filters[category][id][$eq]=:categoryId` - Get subcategories by category

## Seeding the Data

To seed the categories and subcategories, run one of the following commands:

### Option 1: Run the dedicated category seed script
```bash
cd Backend/my-strapi-project
node run-category-seed.js
```

### Option 2: Run the main seed script (includes categories)
```bash
cd Backend/my-strapi-project
npm run seed
```

## Integration with Frontend

The frontend can now fetch categories and subcategories from the backend API to populate the filtering system. The data structure matches what's expected by the frontend components.

### Example API Usage

```javascript
// Fetch all categories with their subcategories
const response = await fetch('/api/categories?populate=subcategories');
const categories = await response.json();

// Fetch subcategories for a specific category
const categoryId = 1;
const subcategoriesResponse = await fetch(`/api/subcategories?filters[category][id][$eq]=${categoryId}`);
const subcategories = await subcategoriesResponse.json();
```

## Permissions

Public read permissions have been set up for both collections, allowing the frontend to fetch category and subcategory data without authentication.

## Notes

- All categories and subcategories are created with `publishedAt` set to the current date
- Slugs are automatically generated from the names
- The relationship between categories and subcategories is properly established
- The data structure matches the frontend expectations for filtering and navigation
